# ezFluent

Small Firefox extension to automatically do practice quizzes on GoFluent.

## Installation

Since this extension is not published on the Firefox Add-ons website, you have to install it manually on your browser. Please keep in mind that this is usually not good practice and you should review the code before installing untrusted add-ons on your browser.

1. Browse to `about:debugging`
2. Open `This Firefox` tab
3. Click on `Load temporary addon`
4. Open `manifest.json` file

## How to use

Go to your [GoFluent portal](https://portal.gofluent.com/app/dashboard) and open a **training path**.
Then use the basic UI at the top of the web page :

| Button | Action |
| :- | :- |
| Show | Show the answer of the current question |
| Auto Quiz | Auto complete the current Quiz |
| Full Auto | Perform all quizzes of the current training path |
| Full Auto Retake | Same but retake all done quizzes |
